# Cyberpunk Portfolio Website

Welcome to my cyberpunk-themed portfolio — a digital space that reflects my lifelong passion for technology, retro aesthetics, and immersive experiences.

## Tech Stack

This project is built using modern, powerful tools that ensure both performance and style:

- **Next.js** – for optimized performance, server-side rendering (SSR), and routing.
- **Tailwind CSS** – chosen for its seamless integration with Next.js and rapid styling capabilities.
- **Redux** – powers the interactive terminal, managing state across various components of the site.
- **Framer Motion** – delivers fast, smooth, and customizable animations throughout the interface.
- **Resend** – handles email delivery for the contact form, allowing visitors to get in touch directly.

## Pages & Features

The website includes **five main pages** and **one hidden retro page**, offering a blend of functionality and creativity:

### 1. Landing Page
The first point of contact, featuring an interactive terminal. Users can navigate using either mouse input or command-line instructions. Expect Easter eggs and surprise interactions for the curious explorer.

### 2. Home Page
A quick overview of who I am, with easy access to my contact information for visitors who want to connect quickly.

### 3. About Page
A deeper dive into my story, values, and professional journey — including a skills section and career timeline.

### 4. Projects Page
The most unique page on the site. Visitors enter a pixel-art space mini-game where they pilot a shuttle through planets (projects). Clicking on a planet opens a detailed Notion page with more information about each project.

### 5. Contact Page
A clean and simple form for visitors to send messages directly to me via email.

### Secret Retro Page
For advanced users who explore the terminal commands, there's a hidden, retro-styled newspaper layout version of the entire website — compressed into one scrollable, old-school web page.

## Extras

- More Easter eggs and surprises will be added over time.
- This site was designed not just as a portfolio, but as a creative expression of who I am and how I see the digital world.
